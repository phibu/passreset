# PassReset — Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-04-15

## Project Reference

- **Project:** PassReset (self-service AD password change portal)
- **Core value:** Reliable, secure, self-service password change that fits corporate AD environments without bespoke deployment engineering
- **Baseline version:** v1.2.2
- **Current milestone:** v1.3.1 (AD Diagnostics patch)
- **Milestone chain:** v1.2.3 ✅ → v1.3.0 ✅ → v1.3.1 (active) → v2.0.0
- **Current focus:** Phase 07 (AD Diagnostics) — promoted from backlog 999.1

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.3.1 — NOT STARTED
Next: Phase 07 (v1.3.1 AD Diagnostics) — needs `/gsd-discuss-phase 7` then `/gsd-plan-phase 7`

- **Phase:** 07 active
- **Next:** `/gsd-discuss-phase 7` to shape the diagnostic logging plan
- **Status:** BUG-004 mapped; Phase 07 dir created at `.planning/phases/07-v1-3-1-ad-diagnostics/`
- **Progress:** [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Milestone Map

| Milestone | Phases | Status |
|---|---|---|
| v1.2.3 | 01 | ✅ Shipped 2026-04-14 (archived) |
| v1.3.0 | 02, 03 | ✅ Shipped 2026-04-15 (archived) |
| v1.3.1 | 07 | Active — 0/1 plans |
| v2.0.0 | 04, 05, 06 | Queued — 0/3 phases started |

## Performance Metrics

- Phases complete: 3/6 (01, 02, 03)
- Plans complete in shipped milestones: 12/12 (01: 3/3, 02: 5/5, 03: 4/4)
- Requirements delivered: BUG-001..003, QA-001, FEAT-001..004 (8/11 from the 3-milestone chain)
- Releases shipped: 2/3 (v1.2.3, v1.3.0)

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

- **2026-04-13:** MSI packaging rolled back; PowerShell installer is the supported deployment path
- **2026-04-14:** v1.2.3 scoped as bugs-only hotfix; v1.3 runs QA-001 (tests) in parallel with UX features
- **2026-04-14:** Coarse granularity + parallel plan execution chosen for the three-milestone chain
- **2026-04-14:** Tech stack locked (React 19 / MUI 6 / ASP.NET Core 10) for v1.2.3 and v1.3.0; v2.0 may introduce cross-platform infrastructure
- **2026-04-15:** Phase 03-02 split across two sessions; client half recovered via forensics and committed as 133a2a4

### Active TODOs

- `/gsd-discuss-phase 7` — shape the AD diagnostic logging approach
- `/gsd-plan-phase 7` — produce 07-01-PLAN.md (single cohesive logging refactor)
- Execute → verify → ship v1.3.1 patch release
- After v1.3.1 ships: pivot to v2.0 Phase 04 (Multi-OS PoC)

### Blockers

- None

### Notes

- Forensic report for 2026-04-15 partial-commit recovery: `.planning/forensics/report-20260415-122540.md`
- Backlog item 999.1 (E_ACCESSDENIED diagnosis) captured and parked — committed as bfb413f
- `CLAUDE.md` still contains stale `<!-- GSD:project-start -->` markers referring to the rolled-back MSI v2.0 scope. Authoritative v2.0 scope lives in `.planning/PROJECT.md` and `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## Session Continuity

- **Previous session (2026-04-15 AM):** Forensic recovery + phase 03 completion (phases 02/03 shipped, PR #17 merged, tag v1.3.0 pushed, release.yml published `PassReset-v1.3.0.zip`).
- **This session (2026-04-15 PM):** Closed v1.2.3 and v1.3.0 milestones — archives at `milestones/v1.2.3-ROADMAP.md`, `v1.2.3-REQUIREMENTS.md`, `v1.3.0-ROADMAP.md`, `v1.3.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`. ROADMAP.md collapsed to active v2.0 phases. REQUIREMENTS.md scoped to V2-001..003. STATE.md rolled to v2.0.0.
- **Next session:** Triage Dependabot branches → `/gsd-cleanup` phase dirs → `/gsd-discuss-phase 4` (or `/gsd-new-milestone` for a fuller context refresh).

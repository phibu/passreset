## v2.0.0 — Platform evolution

### Research + PoC

- [ ] **V2-001**: Research + PoC for multi-OS support — a documented path to Linux/Docker without `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement`; PoC Docker image performs a password change against a test AD; decision captured (Novell.Directory.Ldap.NETStandard vs alternative). Stays a research phase; full migration deferred if blockers found.
- [ ] **V2-002**: Local password-protection database — operator-managed banned words/terms list + attempted-pwned lookup table; provider consults the local store and enforces bans even when stricter than AD policy; LICENSE-compatible integration if borrowing from lithnet/ad-password-protection.
- [ ] **V2-003**: Secure config storage — secrets in `appsettings.Production.json` (SMTP, reCAPTCHA, LDAP creds) no longer stored as cleartext on disk by default. Supported mechanism chosen from DPAPI / ASP.NET Core Data Protection / Credential Manager / optional Key Vault adapter. Clear upgrade path for existing installs.

## Cross-cutting constraints (apply to every requirement)

- **No breaking config changes** for operators upgrading from v1.3.x unless explicitly documented in `UPGRADING.md`.
- **Commit convention** enforced by `.githooks/commit-msg` — types: `feat fix refactor docs chore test ci perf style`; scopes: `web provider common deploy docs ci deps security installer`.
- **CI**: GitHub Actions on `windows-latest`; release triggered by `git tag vX.Y.Z` → `release.yml`. Tests gate release via reusable `tests.yml`.
- **Tech stack**: ASP.NET Core 10 / React 19 / MUI 6 / Vite. v2.0 may introduce cross-platform infrastructure (Novell LDAP, Docker) but must not break the existing Windows/IIS deployment path.
- **Documentation**: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and affected `docs/*.md` updated as part of each release.

---

## Out of Scope

- **MSI packaging** — deferred after the 2026-04-13 rollback. PowerShell installer remains the supported deployment path.
- **Password reset via email/SMS** — portal is *change* only.
- **SSO / federation adapters** — direct-AD portal.
- **Stack modernization** (e.g., migrating to .NET 11, React 20) — not part of this milestone.

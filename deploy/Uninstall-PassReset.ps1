.SYNOPSIS
    Removes a PassReset installation from IIS, the Windows Service manager, and the file system.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script reverses what Install-PassReset.ps1 created:
      1. Stops and removes the PassReset Windows Service, if one is registered (Phase 14 Service hosting mode).
      2. Stops and removes the IIS site.
      3. Stops and removes the IIS application pool.
      4. Removes the physical deployment folder and its contents.
      5. Optionally removes dated backup folders left by previous upgrades.

    Nothing else is touched: IIS, IIS features, the .NET Hosting Bundle,
    certificates, and all other sites/pools are left completely intact.

.PARAMETER SiteName
    Name of the IIS site and/or Windows Service to remove. Both are expected
    to share this name by convention. Default: PassReset

.PARAMETER AppPoolName
    Name of the IIS application pool to remove. Default: PassResetPool

.PARAMETER PhysicalPath
    Deployment folder to delete. Default: C:\inetpub\PassReset

.PARAMETER KeepFiles
    Remove the IIS site and app pool but leave the physical folder on disk.
    Useful when you want to preserve appsettings.Production.json for a reinstall.

.PARAMETER RemoveBackups
    Also remove dated backup folders created by the installer during upgrades
    (folders matching ${PhysicalPath}_backup_*).

.PARAMETER Force
    Skip the confirmation prompt. Use for unattended / scripted uninstalls.

.EXAMPLE
    # Interactive — prompts for confirmation before removing anything:
    .\Uninstall-PassReset.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    # Unattended — remove everything including upgrade backups, no prompt:
    .\Uninstall-PassReset.ps1 -Force -RemoveBackups

.EXAMPLE
    # Remove IIS config only — keep files on disk for a reinstall:
    .\Uninstall-PassReset.ps1 -KeepFiles
